Before any of you think about uploading this to Garrysmod.org, stop!
If I find that anyone besides myself, has uploaded this addon to garrysmod.org, dont expect it to stay there very long.

I will upload the addon to garrysmod.org when I reach an important stage in developement, or made a significant change to the addon.

You can get access to the latest version by using any SVN software to download it from the following:
http://tools.assembla.com/svn/lsextension/



FOR SVN NOOBS
=============
if you dont know how to use an SVN, here's how:
	1) Download and install TortoiseSVN from: http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads
	2) Create a new folder called 'LS Extended'
	3) Right click on the folder
	4) click 'SVN Checkout...'
	5) enter the following into the URL box: http://tools.assembla.com/svn/lsextension/
	6) click OK
	7) Your Done!

When you want to update to the latest version:
	1) right click the folder:
	2) mouseover 'tortoise SVN'
	3) click 'update' at the top of the 'Tortoise SVN' submenu

Now, if that isnt simple enough.... go back to sleep.
