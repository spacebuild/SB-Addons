Current Version : 1.11

Q: What's new in Version 1.11?
A: Fixed a small bug when using hydro power station on Overdrive setting.

Q: I saw a file named "energysystems" and "advls" what will happen to my life support?
A: Nothing, "energysystems" is a clean, default config file of Life Support generators,
   and advls is short for "Advanced Life Support" which will add a new section to the
   life support and a new category.

SENTs which this addon adds:

1. Advanced Heavy Water Electrolyzer (UPDATED).
This generator has been modified for good electrolyzed water production.

For: 
1) Enormous amount of Heavy Water is produced.

Against:
1) Huge amount of resources are needed to launch it up.
2) 30 Seconds pause between each electrolyzing process.

2. Air-To-Coolant generator.
Coolant Compressor has been modified to cool down air in order to make it great for
cooling processes.

For:
1) Generates plenty of coolant in a short period of time.

Against:
1) Air needed.

3. Air-To-Steam generator.
This generator was upgraded to create steam by heating up air, the generator uses a bit
of steam to keep the temperature high in order to create steam.

For:
1) No water is needed.

Against:
1) Much air is need to product 50% steam.

4. Steam-To-Water generator.
This generator has been modified from a generator which extracted air from water.
But it was modified to create water from steam.

For:
1) None.

Against:
1) High amount of resources are needed in order to create 33% water from 100% steam 
(i mean that it takes lots of resources not 100% steam - it takes a needed amount of 
steam).
2) 4 Seconds pause between each steam cooling down process.

5. Advanced TerraJuice(R) Generator.
The generator was modified not to use Terra crystals, instead the generator creates 
Terra crystals by using all the resources which are needed.

For:
1) None Terra crystals are needed.

Against:
1) Medium production time.
2) Lots of energy is used.

6. Hydro Power Station (UPDATED).
What's there to say about it? Just a power station that works on water.

For:
1) No resources are needed except water.
2) Great energy output.

Against:
1) Uses alot of water.

Now that you're welcome with the sents, I can tell you how much resources a generator
needs/generates.

1. Advanced Heavy Water Electrolyzer. 
Needed resources to launch:
1) 10000 Energy.
2) 1000 Water.
3) 1000 Air.

Produces:
1000 Heavy Water.

2. Air-To-Coolant Generator.
Needed resources to launch:
1) 200 Air.
2) 250 Energy.

Produces:
500 Coolant.

3. Air-To-Steam.
Needed resources to launch:
1) 300 Energy.
2) 300 Air.
Produces:
150 Steam.

4. Steam-To-Water.
Needed resources to launch:
1) 400 Energy.
2) 300 Steam.
Produces:
100 Water.

5. Advanced TerraJuice(R) Generator:
Needed resources to launch:
1) 1000 Energy.
2) 300 Air.
3) 300 Water.

Produces:
150 Terrajuice.

6. Hydro Power Station:
Needed resources to launch:
1) 250 Water.
Produces:
2) 2500 Energy.

This is version 1.1, many new generators will be in other versions (I hope).
Thank you for downloading it and using it :).

P.S. on some Generators you will see and additional "Air:" and "Energy: panel, ignore it 
it's a bug.
